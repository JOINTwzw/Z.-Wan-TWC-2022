The Matlab codes correspond to Figs. 8 and 10 in [R1]. One can change the parameters the .m file entitled "main_..." for different settings.

main_dRx_HybridRadar.m
  This is for Fig. 8 in [R1], investigating the influence of element spacing and dictionary dimension on the sensing performance.

main_Ptx_HybridRadar
  This is for Fig. 10 (or 11) in [R1], showing the sensing performance of different algorithms.
